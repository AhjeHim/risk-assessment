Here I have conducted a risk assesssment for a company. The first thing I did was create a control categories list. 
Then I created a Risk assessment report. Detailing the scope and goals, while also listing all the issues we found during the audit.
The last thing I did was create a Controls and compliance checklist, followed by a Recommendations report for the company I audited.
